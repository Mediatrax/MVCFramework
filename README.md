# MVCFramework
This is a very minimalistic MVC based Framework for PHP. You can use this simple infrastructure to build great Webpages!

## Config

 1. Change your Path in the .htaccess
 2. Connect to your db in the core model
 3. The log feature is only for testing! Don't use the function when you publish your projekt!
